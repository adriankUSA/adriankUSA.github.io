                <p>My biggest hobby is definitely playing video games. This includes arcade rhythm games, mobile games, role playing games, FPS games, RTS, but the one genre I cannot escape is <b>competitive video games</b>. 
                <br>
                    I have reached the top .001% in Overwatch and Teamfight Tactics, and I am currently only Celestial II in Marvel Rivals (top ~0.50%) since I have not played ranked much.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The competitive games that I enjoy are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Marvel Rivals</b> - A Third Person Hero Shooter where you play a 6v6 game where you try to capture or push an objective, featuring heroes and villains from Marvel.</li>
                        <li><b>Overwatch</b> - A First Person Hero Shooter where you also push or capture objectives, but features original characters by Blizzard, known for World of Warcraft and Diablo.</li>
                        <li><b>Teamfight Tactics</b> - An 8 player Free-for-all auto chess game where you battle to be first place or top 4, featuring Riot Game's League of Legends characters.</li>
                        <li><b>Valorant</b>- A First Person Tactical shooter, where you either eliminate the enemy, successfully plant a spike, or defuse a spike, by Riot Games.</li>
                        <li><b>Tekken 8</b> - A 3D fighting game featuring original characters from representing a multitude of cultures who somehow understand each other while speaking different languages, by Bandai Namco</li>
                    </ul>

                <p>
                    I started playing competitive video games when I was in about 16 in High School (2015, yeah I'm a little old). I was never good until I built and bought my first ever PC at 19 years old, which I'm sure every gamer who can relate remembers.
                    <br>
                    I built a PC with a 1060 GPU, AMD Ryzen 2600 with the fan halfway screwed in, and immediately started playing Overwatch. I still was not great, and I also ended up playing Valorant when that came out, but after some time of playing both games,
                    <br>
                    I started developing a lot of game sense, hitting Immortal in Valorant and top 500 in Overwatch. That cost me 7 years of failed community college, but grew my brain so much that I have done so well in University (ironically except literally this class)
                    <br>
                    I developed my critical thinking skills so much, and also made amazing life long friends, and I have played with some of my favorite streamers and pros. I don't even regret failing school, because I would never have gotten this far.
