            <h3> Good CRAP Website: <a class="CRAP" href="https://www.superlist.com/">Superlist</a></h3>
            <p>Superlist is an all-in-one workspace for your to-dos, lists, notes, and projects.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast: </strong> Superlist uses bright red, blue, purple, and white that contrast the black-grey background while also complimenting it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition: </strong> The website repeats its color patterns, reuses fonts, alignments, and images/styles of images.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment: </strong> The website uses mostly a centered alignment in about the middle third of the screen, only having it different for the hero section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity: </strong> Sections are grouped appropriately with very nice spacing.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3> Bad CRAP Website: <a class="CRAP" href="http://www2.pnwx.com/">Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc.</a></h3>
            <p>Pacific Northwest X-Ray Inc. is a company that sells X-Ray products and apparel.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Contrast: </strong> Colors do not contrast well, black on dark blue makes it hard to see.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Repetition: </strong> Well, the website does repeat its color schemes and patterns and images, but the execution is poor.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Alignment: </strong> The alignment is okay, it is all centered at the very least.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Proximity: </strong> Sections do not seem grouped together because there is very little spacing and everything is aligned the same. It is hard to gather your eyes to a specific section with intent.
                </li>
            </ul>
